<!-- 
  1) add ng-app attribute and give it a name.
  2) create an angular module with the same name as the ng-app name. A module is like the 
        application definition. All controllers, services and directives belong to a module.
  3) define a controller that will initialize a message property on a scope object.
  4) place the ng-controller directive on the HTML tag that wants to use the controller.
  5) place the ng-bind attribute with the specified value in the h2 tag so it knows which
        message to show.
  6) place the ng-model attribute to the input tag to allow whatever message typed to be 
        bound to $scope.message in the controller. This facilitates passing of data from
        the view to the controller, ng-model acts as a two-way binding.
  7) {{}} anything written in double curly braces are treated as angular expressions.
        If it's used with $scope properties, like this {{message}}, it will evaluate to
        ng-bind.
